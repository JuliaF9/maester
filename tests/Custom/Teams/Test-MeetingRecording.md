8.5.9 (L2) Ensure meeting recording is off by default

**Description:**
This setting controls the ability for a user to initiate a recording of a meeting in progress.

**Rationale:**
Disabling meeting recordings in the Global meeting policy ensures that only authorized
users, such as organizers, co-organizers, and leads, can initiate a recording. This
measure helps safeguard sensitive information by preventing unauthorized individuals
from capturing and potentially sharing meeting content. Restricting recording
capabilities to specific roles allows organizations to exercise greater control over what is
recorded, aligning it with the meeting's confidentiality requirements.
